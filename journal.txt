TASK LIST:

- need to read/think about about syllables vs. phonemes..

DONE TASKS:

- settled on CMU database. Moby database is missing plurals ("hands"), has bunch of pointless phrases (like "bad actor"..wtf?), and has weird phoneme format
- partial score for close-consonants, like S vs. Z, T vs. D
- Difference pronunciations for same spelling, ie. “I’m so close” vs. “Close the door”
	CMU lists variants, with close(2) etc. Just check all of them
